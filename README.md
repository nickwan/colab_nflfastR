# nflfastR Google Colab starter notebook  
The purpose of this notebook is to get data from the `nflfastR-data` GitHub repo into a Google Colab environment. This is not a perfect 1:1 replacement for the `nflfastR` R library, but it is the basis of the library -- the data that supports all the play-by-play statistics.  

In this notebook, you'll be able to:  
* Import data from the `nflfastR` GitHub repo into your Google Drive  
* Load that data into Google Colab via `pandas`  
* Produce very simple data aggregation  
* Produce very simple data visualization
